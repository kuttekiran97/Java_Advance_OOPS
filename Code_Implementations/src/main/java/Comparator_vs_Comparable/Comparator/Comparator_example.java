/**  When to use Comparator : -
 * Now, suppose we want to sort movies by their rating and names as well.
 * When we make a collection element comparable(by having it implement Comparable), we get only one chance to implement the compareTo() method.
 * The solution is using Comparator.
 * <p>
 *
 *  Comparator:-
 * Unlike Comparable, Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing. Itâ€™s a separate class.
 * We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members.
 * Collections class has a second sort() method and it takes Comparator. The sort() method invokes the compare() to sort objects.
